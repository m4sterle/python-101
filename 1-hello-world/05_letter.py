What I want to accomplish:
As a current medical student venturing out of her comfort zone into the world of programming, I've found so much solace in the collaborative and supportive nature of the coding community. I'm hoping to bring a little bit of that back into my realm of medicine and hopefully find bad ass ways to diagnose these 'mf diseases.

A little message to my older, wiser, and programmer self:
Sup, future Detective Le. If this little piece of python code circles back to you sometime in the future, I hope you’re reading it with a smile—for one, who would have ever thunk you’re biology-studying ass would be writing something in python and two.) because you ended up doing something cool with what you learned that catered to that intersection between medicine and coding in that you wanted to see. Here's to you, the awesome coder doubling as a detective.
